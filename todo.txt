1. Barb points out that it's commonly shown as F-Rule (vs. L-Rule), so could you please change that.
2. When you hit "Check" the answer image should show up in the graphic area (I've attached images with F-Rule updates).
3. Center the angles (in the pulldown).
4. Keep track of which are correct or not (score included).
5. Have bigger splash for "Correct" and "Incorrect" along with noise (mute button included).
6. Click "Next" to go to the next question.
7. Add a little bit of instructions, per the graphic below.
I just did a quick PS, so the white boxes aren't intended, just the
pulldown boxes spread out so they have the instructions above.
